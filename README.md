# Titanic-Disaster-SQL-Analysis

**Description:**

This project delves into the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic, utilizing SQL queries to explore various aspects of the disaster and its aftermath. By analyzing the available data on passengers, their demographics, ticket details, and survival status, we aim to uncover insights into the events surrounding one of the most infamous maritime disasters in history.

**Queries Implemented:**

1. **Discount Calculation for Surviving Female Passengers:** This query lists the discount dollar value for 10 female passengers who survived the sinking, where the discount price of the ticket is set at 10% of the original ticket price.
   
2. **Average Fare Price for Surviving Female Passengers:** Showcases the average fare price for female passengers who survived the sinking.

3. **Details of Female First-Class Survivors:** Lists the names and the number of siblings, parents, or children accompanying 10 female first-class passengers who survived the sinking.

4. **Average Age of First-Class Male Passengers who Died:** Displays the average age of first-class male passengers who tragically perished in the sinking.

5. **Gender-wise Distribution of First-Class Passenger Fatalities:** Lists the number of female and male first-class passengers who died in the sinking, providing insights into the gender disparity in survival rates.

6. **Survival Rates by Passenger Class:** Analyzes survival rates across different passenger classes, shedding light on the impact of socioeconomic status on survival chances.

7. **Survival Rates by Age Group:** Explores survival rates based on age groups, uncovering patterns in the vulnerability of certain age demographics.

8. **Impact of Family Size on Survival:** Investigates the influence of family size on survival, examining whether traveling with family members affected the likelihood of survival.

9. **Survival Rates by Embarkation Port:** Analyzes survival rates based on the port of embarkation, identifying potential factors contributing to differential survival rates.

10. **Comparison of Survival Rates Across Gender and Class:** Compares survival rates across gender and passenger classes, providing a comprehensive overview of the disparities in survival outcomes.

11. **Survival Rates Among Families vs. Individuals:** Investigates survival rates among passengers traveling with family members versus those traveling alone, offering insights into the role of companionship during the disaster.

12. **Analysis of Survival Among Crew Members:** Explores survival patterns among crew members, highlighting the sacrifices made by those working onboard.

13. **Investigation of Survival Patterns Among Special Passenger Groups:** Examines survival patterns among special passenger groups, such as notable individuals or passengers with unique circumstances.

**Conclusion:**

Through meticulous SQL analysis, this project aims to deepen our understanding of the Titanic disaster, uncovering insights into the factors that influenced survival outcomes among its passengers. By examining various facets of the tragedy, we honor the memory of those who perished and seek to learn from this historic event.
